## üßÆ Methodology

The design and analysis process was carried out in two major phases ‚Äî **MATLAB-based system-level verification** and **Xschem circuit-level implementation** using the Skywater PDK. The workflow followed a top-down design approach to ensure theoretical accuracy and practical feasibility.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ MATLAB Design and Pre-Simulation
- Implemented the **Tow‚ÄìThomas biquad topology** mathematically to derive the transfer function.
- Designed a **4th-order Butterworth response** by cascading two second-order biquads.
- Generated **Bode magnitude, phase**, and **pole-zero plots** to validate theoretical performance.
- Computed precise **resistor and capacitor values (R, C)** to meet the target cutoff frequency (50 kHz).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Xschem Circuit-Level Realization
- Modeled the **operational amplifier** using an ideal **voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS)** with adjustable gain and bandwidth.
- Implemented the **Tow‚ÄìThomas filter** using MATLAB-derived component values.
- Simulated the design in **Xschem** under different op-amp gains and **unity-gain bandwidths (UGB)** to study non-ideal effects.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Evaluation
- Compared MATLAB and Xschem frequency responses to ensure design consistency.
- Analyzed how finite op-amp gain and bandwidth impact **cutoff frequency**, **stability**, and **passband flatness**.
- Determined minimum gain and bandwidth values required for the circuit to meet its Butterworth specifications.

## üìä Results and Analysis

Comprehensive simulations were performed in **MATLAB** and **Xschem** to validate the designed fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter. The results demonstrate strong agreement between system-level and circuit-level responses.

### üîπ 1Ô∏è‚É£ MATLAB Simulation Results
- The MATLAB-based analysis generated **Bode magnitude and phase plots**, confirming a smooth Butterworth response with:
  - Passband ripple ‚â§ 0.5 dB  
  - Cutoff frequency (**fc**) ‚âà 50 kHz  
  - Stopband attenuation < ‚àí40 dB at 80 kHz  
- Pole‚Äìzero plots verified system stability and proper pole placement for a maximally flat passband.

### üîπ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Xschem Simulation Results
The filter was implemented and simulated in Xschem using ideal op-amp models (VCVS) based on the Skywater PDK.  
Two key non-ideal parameters ‚Äî **op-amp gain** and **unity-gain bandwidth (UGB)** ‚Äî were varied to analyze their impact.

#### Effect of Op-Amp Gain
| Op-Amp Gain (dB) | Passband Gain (dB) | ‚àí3 dB Gain (dB) | Cutoff Frequency (MHz) |
|-------------------|--------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| 20 | -2.61 | -5.61 | 38.1 |
| 40 | -0.23 | -3.23 | 49 |
| 60 | -0.02 | -3.02 | 50 |
| 80 | 0 | -3 | 50 |

‚û°Ô∏è As gain increases, passband flatness improves and the cutoff frequency closely aligns with the design target.

#### Effect of Op-Amp Unity-Gain Bandwidth (UGB)
| UGB (MHz) | Cutoff Frequency (MHz) |
|------------|-------------------------|
| 20 | 12.2 |
| 50 | 23.6 |
| 100 | 34.6 |
| 150 | 39.1 |
| 200 | 44.9 |
| 400 | 50.2 |

‚û°Ô∏è Higher UGB ensures accurate cutoff frequency and Butterworth response.  
A minimum UGB of **‚â•100 MHz** is required for optimal performance.

### üîπ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Observations
- MATLAB and Xschem results exhibit excellent correlation, validating the correctness of component selection and topology.  
- Finite op-amp gain and limited bandwidth cause a **shift in cutoff frequency** and **distortion in the passband**.  
- With **80 dB gain** and **200 MHz UGB**, the circuit achieves ideal Butterworth characteristics, confirming robust design stability.

---

**Conclusion:**  
The simulation results confirm that the designed fourth-order Tow‚ÄìThomas low-pass filter meets all target specifications. The methodology effectively bridges MATLAB-based analytical design with Xschem circuit verification, providing a reliable foundation for transistor-level implementation and further optimization.
